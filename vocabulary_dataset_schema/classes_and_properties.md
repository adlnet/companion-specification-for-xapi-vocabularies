## Classes and Properties {#classes-and-properties}

RDF describes resources with classes, properties, and values. RDF Schema (RDFS), OWL, and SKOS provide a framework to model and describe the classes and properties. The following tables provide a list of both the recommended and optional classes and properties for representing xAPI vocabulary datasets as LD. It also contains a description and the functional characteristics for each class and property. In the properties table, the domain specifies for what class the property is defined (i.e., that instances of particular class can have that property). The range says what values can the property take (i.e., what type are the values it can take). Refer to the [xAPI Vocabulary Primer](http://#) for examples on how to apply some of the following classes and properties.
