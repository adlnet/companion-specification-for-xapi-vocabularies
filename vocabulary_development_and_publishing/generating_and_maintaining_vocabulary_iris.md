## Generating and Maintaining Vocabulary IRIs {#generating-and-maintaining-vocabulary-iris}

In order to support xAPI IRI stability and curation, ADL will initially support requests for creating new persistent IRIs. If ADL were no longer operational or if governance of the xAPI changed to another organization, the w3id.org IRIs can be easily udpated via [GitHub](https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org) by anyone in the xAPI community or transitioned to any newly appointed governing organization. The following high-level process outlines the steps involved for minting a new IRI.

1.  Verify that an existing vocabulary term IRI does not already exist by searching the xAPI community resources such as the Registry, **_http://registry.experienceapi.com_** and the xAPI Vocabulary Publishing Server (under development), **_http://xapi.vocab.pub_**_._
2.  Create each vocabulary dataset IRI and vocabulary term IRIs using the [Recommended IRI Design Practices](iri_design_and_persistence.md#recommended-iri-design-practices) provided in the previous section of this document.
3.  Generate and publish the vocabulary as HTML/RDFa and JSON-LD using the recommended classes and properties defined in this specification. A basic example of this is provided in [Appendix A](../appendices/appendix_a_htmlrdfa_vocabulary_dataset_example.md). For more specific guidelines on generating and publishing the RDF, read [Publishing Vocabulary Datasets as HTML/RDFa](publishing_vocabulary_datasets_as_htmlrdfa.md) and [xAPI Vocabulary Primer](https://adl.gitbooks.io/experience-xapi-vocabulary-primer/content/).
4.  Use a dedicated service for creating and maintaining new IRIs. Use a service that supports IRI resolution (redirects) such as **_https://w3id.org_**. Both **_http://purl.org_** and **_http://registry.experienceapi.com_ **provide simple browser-based interfaces for generating IRIs. However, currently [http://purl.org](http://purl.org) is temporarily not allowing new IRIs as it is transitioned to a new organization for governance. Currently, only the **https://w3id.org** service offers a way to resolve the IRIs. This is expected to change and options will improve as this specification has been more widely adopted and implemented. For the technically savvy, the preferred way to create the redirect yourself is by using **_https://w3id.org_** and by following these steps:
    1.  Fork the **_https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org_** source code repository from GitHub.
    2.  Add new re-direct entries for each vocabulary dataset. For an example, see the .htaccess rules in [Appendix B](../appendices/appendix_b_content_negotiation_htaccess_apache_exa.md).
    3.  Add a README.md detailing contact persons or community responsible for maintaining the IRIs
    4.  Commit your changes and submit a pull request.
    5.  The w3id.org administrators will review your pull request and merge it. Once the pull request is merged, the changes go live immediately.
5.  Once the vocabulary IRIs have been published, announce and submit each new vocabulary dataset IRI to the xAPI Vocabulary Publishing Server (**_http://xapi.vocab.pub_**) or each vocabulary term IRI to the Registry (e.g., currently the xAPI Registry, **_https://registry.experienceapi.com_**).
