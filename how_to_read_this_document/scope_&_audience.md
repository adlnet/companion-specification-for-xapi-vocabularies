## Scope & Audience {#scope-audience}

This is a technical document written specifically for individuals and organizations implementing the xAPI. It is applicable to anyone creating new vocabulary terms (Verbs or Activity Types) for xAPI. It is also applicable to any individuals or organizations developing applications for publishing, storing or retrieving vocabulary identifiers and definitions, or any other types of services that need to query the semantic meaning of xAPI vocabulary data.

This document will provide only a brief overview of RDF. Further reading is available in the [Resources Section](../additional_resources.md) of this document. Readers looking for additional examples should consult the [xAPI Vocabulary Primer](https://adl.gitbooks.io/experience-xapi-vocabulary-primer/content/). The Primer provides real-world working examples and queries to support the implementation of this technical specification. The Primer also demonstrates semantic mapping relationships between terms, either by linking terms together or by relating them to other resources.
