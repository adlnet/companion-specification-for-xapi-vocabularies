# How to Read this Document {#how-to-read-this-document}

This document provides a basic introduction regarding the application of semantic web technology to xAPI vocabularies, but also formally defines a schema expressed in Web Ontology Language (OWL). The essential parts of this schema are explained in the [Vocabulary Dataset Schema](../vocabulary_dataset_schema/README.md). Here, the reader is presented with the set of elements that are most commonly used for representing xAPI vocabularies as linked datasets. It is expected that authors publishing vocabularies will employ most of the recommended elements presented in this section. The optional elements in the [Vocabulary Dataset Schema](../vocabulary_dataset_schema/README.md) are focused on additional metadata needs, which are likely to be used by vocabulary search interfaces and other semantic applications. 

Properties and classes are **bolded**. 

Code examples are in  ```red text, light gray background```.

Vocabularies and vocabulary term identifiers are all ***```red bold italicized``` ***when described in this documentâ€™s text. 

Internal hyperlinks are [blue text](#) and external links are [***bold blue italicized***](#).
